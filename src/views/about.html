            <p>Transaudit is a condition assessment company who specialise in the assessment of transformers – oil filled, cast resin and dry types, and have engineers with more than 20 years experience in their fields involved in all facets of the company.</p>
            <p>We understand that no two companies operate the same, we understand that companies probably have a huge repository of data, we also understand that there are very few engineers dedicated to looking after the transformer assets anymore.</p>
            <p>This is where Transaudit steps in and empowers the asset manager with knowledge of their network – gives them the best opportunity to make the best decisions based on the most accurate</p>
            <p>Transaudit takes responsibility for ensuring sure the job is done right When employing Transaudit as your assessment tool, transaudit will collect your existing data, enter the existing data, analyise this data, collect new data, assess and recommend.</p>
            <p>Our process is simple.</p>
            <p>Our technicians attend site, collect oil samples for DGA*, inspect and audit the equipment, collect your on-site existing transformer, SCADA, DGA and load data.</p>
            <p>Once this data is received, our office staff enter your new and existing data into our Transaudit online condition assessment tool.</p>
            <p>Our transformer engineers then assess the data provided, study the information obtained from site, offer recomendations for repairs or additional assessments. This is then peer assessed and the data becomes live – for you the customer to use. Additionally, email notifications warn you 30 days out of any requirement such as inspection or oil rests required.</p>
            <p>Is this the level of service your provider gives you now?</p>
            <p>If the answer is no, you need to talk with Transaudit – kim@transaudit.org</p>

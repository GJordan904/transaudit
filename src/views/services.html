                <hr>
                <p>Often we get asked what particular information means in supplied reports. These reports can be from Factory Tests (FAT) or from Field Tests (SAT) on new or existing transformers.</p>
                <p>Transaudit provides a service to interpret your results and give to you in plain English what they mean – good or bad. We often see that a lot of false information is provided, default comments from some oil laboratories in Australia offer less than accurate information – the most recent seen being a DGA report on an OLTC suggesting arcing was present and to inspect!</p>
                <p>No nonsense, accurate, precise and written without the hyperbole – that is what you will get.</p>
                <p>Our auditing system also falls under the reporting banner – you get promised the best, we actually deliver.</p>

                <p>Transaudit can provide project management for the installation and commissioning of new transformers, relocation of existing transformers, factory acceptance testing, scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, failure analysis, retro-fitting, up-rating and end of life decommissioning.</p>
                <p>When it comes to maintenance, the ability of your subcontractors or even your own staff to pinpoint what needs maintaining as to what can be ignored is critical. The number of times we see subcontractors who genuinely believe they are doing the right thing ignoring the needed repairs is astounding.</p>
                <p>How many times have you seen of or heard of a transformer tripping and the only test done on the tripped unit is a “megger” (insulation resistance) test? Really – what good is that test apart from telling you that there is no dead short.</p>
                <p>This is where skilled management is needed to ensure that re-energising your transformer is not doing more damage than good.</p>
                <p>With independent and critical evaluation of your workforce / subcontractors, we will ensure all works are completed within scope, and any variations to contract will be genuine variations, not variations issued to make up a shortfall in the original tender process.</p>
                <p>If asked to do so, we will also provide a scope of works, critical performance paths during this scope of works, and ensure that once complete, your test reports and work reports are available and checked – even if only an interim report, before you re-energise.</p>
                <p>Remember – a contractor is only as good as their staff ability to do the work. You can have the most recognised name in the industry, but if your front line staff cannot perform the necessary tasks, regardless of who the company is, you are in trouble.</p>
                <p>Don’t risk it, <a ui-sref="app.contact">contact us</a> today and have transaudit manage your projects to ensure security of your network assets.</p>
